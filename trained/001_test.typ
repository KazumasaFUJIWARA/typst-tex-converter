## Global Existence of Solutions to the Semilinear Damped Wave Equation

### Abstract

This note considers the behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the semilinear damped wave equation:

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \Delta u = |u|^p,$$

where $t > 0$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $(u_0, u_1)$ are given by:

$$\left(u_0, u_1\right) = (\varepsilon_0 \varphi, \varepsilon_1 \varphi).$$

We aim to establish the global existence of solutions under the initial conditions:

$$0 < \varepsilon_0 < |\varepsilon_1| = -\varepsilon_1.$$

## Introduction

In this note, we consider the behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the semilinear damped wave equation

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \Delta u = |u|^p,$$

where $t > 0$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $(u_0, u_1)$ are given by

$$\left(u_0, u_1\right) = (\varepsilon_0 \varphi, \varepsilon_1 \varphi).$$

The aim of this manuscript is to establish the global existence of solutions under the initial conditions

$$0 < \varepsilon_0 < |\varepsilon_1| = -\varepsilon_1.$$

with $n = 1$, $(\varepsilon_0, \varepsilon_1) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ small, and $\varphi$ being a regular non-negative function.
